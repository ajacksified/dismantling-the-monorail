          <h1>Goals</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            It is easy to say "set your sights on a goal, and do whatever you
            can to achieve it." however, what is possible is defined by the
            level of craftsmanship placed on the steps along the way. Goals can
            be adjusted, but only if you're prepared for it. Luck favors the
            prepared. Amazon revolutionized.

          <aside class="notes">
            There are multiple scenarios that cause monolithic applications,
            not all of them necessarily evil. Simple applications, CRUD forms
            against databases, wedding registries, blogs, whatever, it doesn't
            make a huge difference. And, most new applications start this way,
            because most new applications start simply. MVP.

          <aside class="notes">
            The most important thing for many new projects is to rapidly
            iterate on a product idea in order to evaluate its usefulness. The
            formation of the MVP. Testing viability before too much investment

          <aside class="notes">
            It is at this stage that the ratio of new features to maintainance
            is greatest- the evolution of an application takes place through
            new features, much like cell division.

          <h6>That's not sarcasm</h6>

          <aside class="notes">
            MVC fits all of these things; it gives you simple, obvious buckets
            to place things. Many developers already understand the concept or
            can learn it quickly. Most web frameworks are MVC, many mobile and
            desktop apps are MV* (MVVM, etc) already.

          <aside class="notes">
            MVC apps supposedly look like this diagram; visitor goes to
            catkarma.com, the url is routed to a controller, which
            populates a view with model data and is returned. The user can then
            vote on pictures of cats.

          <h1>Keep It All In Your Head</h1>

          <aside class="notes">
            Communication overhead is minimal for a small team, whether that
            means you or you and a dozen other people; as long as everyone
            sticks to their well-defined buckets.

        <section>
          <h1>It's Easy</h1>
          <p>for example</p>
          <pre><code>rails new catkarma</code></pre>

          <pre><code>cd catkarma
git init

          <aside class="notes">
            You can have a datbase-connected crud app with all the ideals
            aforementioned after a few lines in a bash shell. Super easy to get

          <h2>Time is Your Enemy</h2>
          <h1>Chaos and Entropy</h1>

          <aside class="notes">
            Not everyone sticks to their well-defined buckets. Html leaks into
            controllers, SQL leaks into helpers (and directly into views), and
            the lines get a whole lot blurrier.

          <h1>Growing Introduces Complexity</h1>

          <aside class="notes">
            Keeping track of what features are where and who maintains what and
            which part of code depends on another gets very complicated,
            quickly.

          <h1>Higher <small>Communication</small> Overhead</h1>
          <h3>Meetings, Standups, &amp; <em>Coordination</em></h3>

          <aside class="notes">
            Suddenly, the communication model isn't as simple as it eas. The
            model, previously optimized for small applications and teams,
            can't fit into your head all at once anymore in a web of complexity.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src="img/inevitable.gif" />

          <aside class="notes">
            Because of the increased communication overhead, it becomes common
            to  do more maintainance than actual feature dev. Time is spent
            learning the way around hacks implemented long ago in dark corners.
            Bringing new devs up to speed takes longer and longer.

          <h1>Big Problems if Test Suite is Lacking</h1>

          <aside class="notes">
            Refactoring becomes a massive beast of a problem without good
            testing, which is really hard to do without stict separation of
            concerns (overuse of helpers, for example.)

          <h1>Upgrading Becomes Hard</h1>
          <h6>Raise your hand if you've ever put off a Rails 3.2 Upgrade</h6>

          <aside class="notes">
            With an entire application written in a single mvc framework,
            upgrading portions - or the framework itself - becomes very
            difficult, as each change potentially affects everything.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h1>One-offs and Duplicated Code</h1>

          <aside class="notes">
            When building a monolithic application for a single use case - such
            as the web - APIs are almost always an afterthought, because the
            app can call itself instead of requiring a well-defined API. Then
            mobile sites / app[ps step in, and one-offs are created.

          <h1>Throw more server instances up</h1>

          <aside class="notes">
            There's one way to scale a monolithic app- well, two. One is to
            profile and optimize whatever you can.  The other is to throw
            more isntances of that app up on more distributed servers.

            Trying to fit things into the right place in a rapidly growing
            applicaiton can be tough. Model logic, view logic (shard and
